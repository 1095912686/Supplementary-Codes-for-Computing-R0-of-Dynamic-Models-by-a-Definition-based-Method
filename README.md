# Supplementary-Codes-for-Computing-R0-of-Dynamic-Models-by-a-Definition-based-Method

DataValidation.m Compares definition-based method (DBM) and next-generation method (NGM) on a published model in <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32843094/> (necessary parameters are included in Betas.xlsx and DataValidation.m)

derivation_GroupedSEIAR.m Computes the interactive R_ij matrix and R_0 via both NGM and DBM. 

other derivation_*.m Compute R0 fordifferent dynamic models. those Results are idential to results given by DBM.
